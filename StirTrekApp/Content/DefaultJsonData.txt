Using this, web developers can draw images directly in their web pages with JavaScript, enabling applications such as games, mapping, and data visualization to offload the rendering to the client.  One problem with the Canvas, though, is that the rendered image is just that: an image.  The user is unable to interact with any of the shapes that are drawn to the Canvas.  However, an open source library called Kinetic bridges that gap, allowing shapes or images to be drawn using the existing Canvas API, event listeners attached to them, and manipulated individually using mouse or touch (i.e., move, scale, and rotate).  This session will introduce how to use the Canvas API and Kinetic.js in a desktop or mobile web application.","SpeakerIds":[6],"TimeSlotId":5,"TrackId":29,"Tags":["JavascriptTrack","StirTrek"]},{"Id":15,"Name":"The Case for Scheme","Abstract":"The mobile market explodes.

Currently, in software, there is an expressed desire to be taken seriously as craftspeople. To this end, we\u0027ve introduced process, metrics and quantifiable boundaries as goal posts to hold up to those who may not understand what is involved in shipping quality software. As this practice becomes normal, developers are faced with an ever-expanding landscape of techniques, practices and pressure from thought leaders to take extra course work or certifications to validate the assertion that you are, in fact, a software developer. While some may see this as a necessary evolution of our field, I see it as a albatross round the neck of the creative developer looking to explore the depths of what is possible. While the safety of a well worn path may provide solace to the uninitiated, I find dogmatic implementation oppressive and exclusionary to those interested in exploring alternative approaches to solving problems with technology. Join me in an exploration of what I believe makes us unique as a subculture in this business world; examples of how we came to be by challenging the established idioms of the past in order to move forward into something exciting and new.
